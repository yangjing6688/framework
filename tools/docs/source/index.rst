AutoIQ Keywords
===========================================
These keywords are from the AutoIQ framework located `here`_.
From the root of the framework there is a keywords directory. This is the directory that will contain
all of the keywords that you can reference in your `Robot`_ or `Pytest`_ test cases. You can search for
a keyword based on the action that you would like to do. When you find the keywords that you are looking for
there are Robot and Pytest examples on how to call that keyword from you test. The Arguments for the keyword
are listed as the :Param values in the common block that are passed in with `named arguments`_ (key = value syntax)
into the keyword.
