# system_pre_reset is an optional set of operations that are
# performed immediately before a CPU reset/reboot.
#
# Each named operation is performed in order.
# Any of the operations may actually reset the CPU/Board.  If no
# operation performs an actual reset, the kernel will eventually
# reach its default action of resetting the CPU.
#

# On the 5520, the CPLD has implemented a selective reset.
#
# You select the various board devices to reset during the CPU reset
# using registers CPURESET0 and CPURESET1, and then drive the CPU_RESET
# using the RESET register.
#
# For compatability with older versions of CPLD, we reset the TPM and then take
# it out of reset.  We will fall through to the Linux CPU reset which performs
# the actual reset/reboot.
#
# Some newer versions of the CPLD will reset the CPU as soon as the TPM is
# reset.
