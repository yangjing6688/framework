IxNetwork
 

DESCRIPTION
 

This parameter is valid only for IxTclNetwork API and represents a list of interfaces previously created using interface_config or another emulation__config command that returns the interfacehandles (for example: BFD).

Starting with IxNetwork 5.60 this parameter accepts handles returned by emulation_dhcp_group_config procedure in the following format: |,-, ... The DHCP ranges are separated from the Interface Index identifiers with the (|) character. The Interface Index identifiers are separated with comas (,). A range of Interface Index identifiers can be defined using the dash (-) character.

Ranges along with the Interface Index identifiers are grouped together in TCL Lists. The lists can contain mixed items, protocol interface handles returned by interface_config and handles returned by emulation_dhcp_group_config along with the interface index.

Example:count 10 (10 BGP neighbors). 3 DHCP range handles returned by ::::emulation_dhcp_group_config. Each DHCP range has 20 sessions (interfaces). If we pass -interface_handle in the following format: [list $dhcp_r1|1,5 $dhcp_r2|1-3 $dhcp_r3|1,3,5-9,13] The interfaces will be distributed to the routers in the following manner:

BGP Neighbor 1: $dhcp_r1 -> interface 1
BGP Neighbor 2: $dhcp_r1 -> interface 5
BGP Neighbor 3: $dhcp_r2 -> interface 1
BGP Neighbor 4: $dhcp_r2 -> interface 2
BGP Neighbor 5: $dhcp_r2 -> interface 3
BGP Neighbor 6: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 1
BGP Neighbor 7: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 3
BGP Neighbor 8: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 5
BGP Neighbor 9: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 6
BGP Neighbor 10: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 7
BGP Neighbor 11: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 8
BGP Neighbor 12: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 9
BGP Neighbor 13 $dhcp_r3 -> interface 13

Starting with IxNetwork 6.30SP1 this parameter accepts handles returned by interface_config procedure with -l23_config_type static_type setting in the following format: |,-, ... The IP ranges are separated from the Interface Index identifiers with the (|) character. The Interface Index identifiers are separated with comas (,). A range of Interface Index identifiers can be defined using the dash (-) character.

Ranges along with the Interface Index identifiers are grouped together in TCL Lists. The lists can contain mixed items, protocol interface handles returned by interface_config with -l23_config_type protocol_interface and with -l23_config_type static_type.

Example:count 10 (10 BGP neighbors). 3 IP range handles returned by ::::interface_config. Each IP range has 20 sessions (interfaces). If we pass -interface_handle in the following format: [list $ip_r1|1,5 $ip_r2|1-3 $ip_r3|1,3,5-9,13] The interfaces will be distributed to the routers in the following manner:


BGP Neighbor 1: $ip_r1 -> interface 1
BGP Neighbor 2: $ip_r1 -> interface 5
BGP Neighbor 3: $ip_r2 -> interface 1
BGP Neighbor 4: $ip_r2 -> interface 2
BGP Neighbor 5: $ip_r2 -> interface 3
BGP Neighbor 6: $ip_r3 -> interface 1
BGP Neighbor 7: $ip_r3 -> interface 3

IxNetwork-NGPF
 

DESCRIPTION
 

This parameter is valid only for IxTclNetwork API and represents a list of interfaces previously created using interface_config or another emulation__config command that returns the interface handles (for example: BFD). Starting with IxNetwork 5.60 this parameter accepts handles returned by emulation_dhcp_group_config procedure in the following format: |,-, ... The DHCP ranges are separated from the Interface Index identifiers with the (|) character. The Interface Index identifiers are separated with comas (,). A range of Interface Index identifiers can be defined using the dash (-) character. Ranges along with the Interface Index identifiers are grouped together in TCL Lists. The lists can contain mixed items, protocol interface handles returned by interface_config and handles returned by emulation_dhcp_group_config along with the interface index. Example: count 10 (10 BGP neighbors). 3 DHCP range handles returned by ::::emulation_dhcp_group_config. Each DHCP range has 20 sessions (interfaces). If we pass a -interface_handle in the following format: [list $dhcp_r1|1,5 $dhcp_r2|1-3 $dhcp_r3|1,3,5-9,13] The interfaces will be distributed to the routers in the following manner: BGP Neighbor 1: $dhcp_r1 -> interface 1 BGP Neighbor 2: $dhcp_r1 -> interface 5 BGP Neighbor 3: $dhcp_r2 -> interface 1 BGP Neighbor 4: $dhcp_r2 -> interface 2 BGP Neighbor 5: $dhcp_r2 -> interface 3 BGP Neighbor 6: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 1 BGP Neighbor 7: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 3 BGP Neighbor 8: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 5 BGP Neighbor 9: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 6 BGP Neighbor 10: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 7 BGP Neighbor 11: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 8 BGP Neighbor 12: $dhcp_r3 -> interface 9 BGP Neighbor 13 $dhcp_r3 -> interface 13 Starting with IxNetwork 6.30SP1 this parameter accepts handles returned by interface_config procedure with -l23_config_type static_type setting in the following format: |,-, ...
