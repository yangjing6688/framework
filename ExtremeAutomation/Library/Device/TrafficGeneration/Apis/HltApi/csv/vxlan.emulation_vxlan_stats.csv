port_handle,"Specifies the port upon which emulation id configured. This parameter is
returned from emulation_dhcp_config proc. Emulation must have been
previously enabled on the specified port via a call to
emulation_dhcp_group_config proc. When -version is ixnetwork, one of
-port_handle or -handle parameters should be provided.

handle,"Allows the user to optionally select the groups to which the specified
action is to be applied. If this parameter is not specified, then the
specified action is applied to all groups configured on the port
specified by the -port_handle command. The handle is obtained from the
keyed list returned in the call to emulation_vxlan_group_config proc.
The port handle parameter must have been initialized and vxlan group
emulation must have been configured prior to calling this function. For
IxTclNetwork the statistics will be aggregated at port level (the port
on which this handle has been configured). The stats aggregate.will
represent the aggregated port stats for the first port if multiple
handles are provided.

parameter is supported using the following APIs: IxTclNetwork. Valid
choices are: clear collect.
Valid options are:

execution_timeout,"This is the timeout for the function. The setting is in seconds. Setting
this setting to 60 it will mean that the command must complete in under
60 seconds. If the command will last more than 60 seconds the command
will be terminated by force. This flag can be used to prevent dead locks
occuring in IxNetwork.
