4 - Link bandwidth community

The second number is the value of the high-order type byte.
Possible values:
128 - IANA bit: This bit may be or'd with any other values.
0 indicates that this is an IANA assignable type using First Come First Serve policy.
1 indicates that this is an IANA assignable type using the IETF Consensus policy.
64 - Transitive bit: This bit may be ordered with any other values.
0 indicates that the community is transitive across ASes and
1 indicates that it is non-transitive.
0 - Two-octet AS specific (default): Value holds a two-octet global ASN followed by a four-bytes local admin value.
1 - IPv4 address specific: Value holds a four-octet IP address followed by a two-bytes local administrator value.
2 - Four-octet AS specific: Value holds a four-octet global ASN followed by a two-bytes local admin value.
3 - Generic: Value holds six-octets.

The third number is the value associated with the extended community. (default = {00 00 00 00 00 00})
Example value: {2,128,03 22 00 00 00 00}. Valid for route type: unicast/multicast (ipv4/6_unicast_nlri, ipv4/6_multicast_nlri), mpls (ipv4/6_mpls_nlri), vpn (ipv4/6_mpls_vpn_nlri).
