port_handle,"Depending on the traffic_generator value, this option has different meanings. If traffic_generator ixnetwork_540 is used this parameter is used ixos/ixnetwork_540 - The port for which to configure traffic.

For traffic_generator ixnetwork_540 this is mandatory on mode create only if parameter -emulation_src_handle is missing.ixnetwork/ixnetwork_540 - The port_handle parameter is not necessary anymore.
