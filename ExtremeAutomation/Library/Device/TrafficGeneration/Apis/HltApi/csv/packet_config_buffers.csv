port_handle,"Depending on the traffic_generator value, this option has different meanings. If traffic_generator ixnetwork_540 is used this parameter is used ixos/ixnetwork_540 - The port for which to configure traffic. Mandatory for -mode create/reset when -traffic_generator is set to ixos. For traffic_generator ixnetwork_540 this is mandatory on mode create only if parameter -emulation_src_handle is missing.ixnetwork/ixnetwork_540 - The port_handle parameter is not necessary anymore. When using IxNetwork, traffic configurations will be done using previously created handles (IP interfaces, PPP ranges, L2TP ranges, Protocol Route Ranges etc.) as sources (parameter -emulation_src_handle) and destinations (-emulation_dst_handle).",port,,"IxNetwork, IxOS/IxNetwork-FT",universal,"IxTclNetwork:7.40.929.15,IxTclHal:6.80","unimplemented",,-port_handle 1/2
action,Supported with IxTclHal. Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status.

capture_mode,"Supported with IxTclHal and IxTclNetwork. Controls whether data capture is performed in a continuous or triggered mode.
Valid options are:
continuous: capture data in the buffer continuously, regardless of trigger settings. Data may be filtered; see continuous_filter.
trigger: (default) capture data only after triggered.",opt,"continuous, trigger","IxNetwork, IxOS/IxNetwork-FT",ixia_only,"IxTclNetwork:7.40.929.15,IxTclHal:6.80","unimplemented",,#NAME?
