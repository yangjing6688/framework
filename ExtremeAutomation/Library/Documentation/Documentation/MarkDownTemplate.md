#   DOCUMENT TITLE - This is an example template written using the MarkDown(MD) format
##  1. HEADING 1
This is an example of 1 HEADING called HEADING 1 followed by a continuous line of text.  If you keep typing on the same line, MarkDown will continue appending on the same line until it hits the end of the available screen size.  The text will then automatically wrap onto the next line and continue going.  In order to force a new line, the user enters a DOUBLE CARRIAGE RETURN.  This forces a new line as opposed to wrapping the text.  
To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅  
Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅

##  7.  INSERTING IMAGES INTO MARKDOWN DOCUMENTS
Inserting images into a markdown document is very similar to inserting links.  The only difference is for images, place a ! in front of the square brackets.  See example below:

    ![Image Name](URL or file path to the image file)

Example:

![This is a picture of the Extreme Networks Logo](Extreme-Networks-WH-on-Purple.jpg)
