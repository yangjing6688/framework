# AutoIQ Framework

This repository is home to the AutoIQ Frameworks for UI and Switch Testing.

##  What is the "AutoIQ Framework"?
* AutoIQ Framework is a collection of open source and internally developed applications.
* Allows users to easily create and execute automation test cases with minimal prior knowledge of scripting or programming.
* Supports regression testing in physical, virtual and cloud test environments.

* The AutoIQ Framework consists of the following components:
    - Custom Low-Level Keyword and User-Defined Keyword libraries for interacting with:
        - Network Elements (Switches, Routers, Access Points etc.)
        - User-Interfaces (XIQ and XIQSE).
        - Traffic Generators
